# flux_led_java
Build status: [![build_status](https://travis-ci.org/phillip-kruger/apiee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phillip-kruger/apiee)
A java wrapper for the flux_led API using Jython
https://github.com/Danielhiversen/flux_led
The classes were made to inherit from java interfaces to enable easy interaction with the Jython bytecode
and getters and setter properties were removed to avoid method naming issues.
